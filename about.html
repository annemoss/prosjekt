      <p> This is my first time coding anything, and I think it's going well. </p>
      <p> I know a lot of the other students have more experience than me, but I think I'll be fine. </p>
      <p> I'm looking forward to this course, and can't wait to start. </p>

        <h2> Questions </h2>
        <p> 1. Servers await requests. The type of request corresponds to the type of server. Web servers respond with web pages etc. </p>
        <p> 2. Clients send requests, hoping to receive answers. </p>
        <p> 3. An IP address is a number that other computers use to identify and communicate with the computer. </p>
        <p> 4. DNS is essentially the same as IP, but easier to memorize. It converts names of websites into IP addresses for us, so we don't have to. </p>
        <p> 5. The internet is the massive mesh-network that allows all computers connected to it to communicate with eachother. WWW is "just" a way to communicate through HTTP over the internet. </p>
        <p> 6. HTML is essentially just templating. It helps your browser put things in the correct orders and sizes. </p>
